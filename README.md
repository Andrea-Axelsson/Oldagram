# Scrimba - Solo Project Oldagram

This is a solution to the Oldagram solo project on Scrimba in the 'Essential CSS concepts'.(https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend).

This project is an imaginative recreation of an Instagram-like platform, specifically tailored to feature historic epic artists. The core theme of this project was to blend the charm of old art with modern web technologies, creating an engaging and interactive social media experience.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

    - Enjoy a unique social media platform featuring historical artists.
    - Interact with posts by liking them, with a CSS animation showing a heart fading in and out.
    - Appreciate the blend of classic art themes with modern web functionality.

## My process

### Built with

    - Vanilla JavaScript for core interactions and dynamic content rendering.
    - CSS animations for interactive UI elements.
    - HTML5 for structuring the web application.
    - Font Awesome Icons for visual enhancements.
    - Integration with uuid for unique identifiers in JavaScript.

### What I learned

Developing this Instagram clone was an exhilarating experience. One of the most challenging yet rewarding parts was implementing CSS animations, particularly making the heart icon fade in and out when a post is liked. This not only improved my understanding of CSS keyframes and animations but also deepened my grasp of JavaScript event handling.

Another key learning was effective DOM manipulation for dynamically updating content, simulating a real-time social media experience. This involved complex logic, especially for toggling the like status and updating the likes count.

### Continued development

Looking forward, I am excited to delve deeper into advanced CSS animations and perhaps integrate more sophisticated JavaScript frameworks to enhance user experience and application performance. Expanding the application to include more interactive features, such as comments and sharing, is also on the horizon.
